####Overview
Wander is a website designed to assist a user with everything that goes into planning a road trip. I have been traveling around the US for the last 6 months exploring and camping out of my truck and I have included all of the basic functions that I would want out of a road trip planning website. For each trip that the user plans they will be able create a packing list, pick their stops using an interactive map, and create itineraries for each stop.
